            <h1>Hi, I`m Chris Ian Sedon</h1>
            <h3>Frontend developer</h3>
            <p>i am on a journey to become a web designer, merging my artistic creativity with technical precision to build digital experiences. 
                I am passionate about creating both aesthetically pleasing and functional, user-friendly interfaces that work across all devices. 
                I am committed to never stop learning, constantly adapting to new trends, tools, and coding languages. 
                My ultimate goal is to solve problems and communicate a brand's story effectively through thoughtful layout, color, typography, and imagery. 
                I am excited by the prospect of a rewarding career that allows me to help shape the internet, one thoughtful website at a time.
